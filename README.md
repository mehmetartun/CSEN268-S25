### Lecture 13 - Step 0 - Implementing Future Builder, Shimmer, Stream Builder

We start this class with a blank page called `FutureBuilderPage` and we import the `shimmer` library:
```zsh
flutter pub add shimmer
```

In the rest of the class we will implement the `FutureBuilder`.

### Setting up your environment before the lecture

Each lecture is stored under a separate tag. In your computer do the following

    git clone <Repository Name>
    git pull
    git tag -l

This will list you all the tags in the repository such as

    L05.00
    L05.01
    ...
    L06.00
    ...

In order to pull a particular tag like L06.00 to your computer

    git checkout tags/L06.00 -b l06_00
