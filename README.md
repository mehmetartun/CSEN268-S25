## Lecture 18 - Flutter Web, WebView and Ads
In this lecture we will explore Flutter Web, WebView and Ads

### Step 00 - Start with a generic page and deploy to web
We point to a generic page titled **Welcome to Web** and we will deploy this to the web.

### Build for Web
We first build our project for web:
```zsh
>>> flutter build web

Font asset "CupertinoIcons.ttf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 257628 to 1172 bytes (99.5% reduction).
Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 7692 bytes (99.5%
reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.
Compiling lib/main.dart for the Web...                             18.3s
✓ Built build/web
```

### Setup Hosting configuration
To deploy to **Firebase Hosting** you need to run **firebase init** in order to set up hosting configuration to your [firebase.json](/firebase.json) file:
```zsh
MA@MBP:~/Development/csen268/CSEN268-F24> firebase init

     ######## #### ########  ######## ########     ###     ######  ########
     ##        ##  ##     ## ##       ##     ##  ##   ##  ##       ##
     ######    ##  ########  ######   ########  #########  ######  ######
     ##        ##  ##    ##  ##       ##     ## ##     ##       ## ##
     ##       #### ##     ## ######## ########  ##     ##  ######  ########

You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/mehmetartun/Development/csen268/CSEN268-F24

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter
 to confirm your choices. (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection, and <enter> to
 proceed)
 ◯ Genkit: Setup a new Genkit project with Firebase
 ◯ Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files
 ◯ App Hosting: Configure an apphosting.yaml file for App Hosting
❯◯ Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys
 ◯ Storage: Configure a security rules file for Cloud Storage
 ◯ Emulators: Set up local emulators for Firebase products
 ◯ Remote Config: Configure a template file for Remote Config
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```
after that you need to specify your **public** directory. This will be `build/web` for a Flutter project. Enter `build/web` for the public directory:
```zsh
=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project fir-messaging-8b691 (firebase-messaging)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? build/web
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? (y/N) y
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? (y/N) N
? File build/web/index.html already exists. Overwrite? (y/N) N
```

Now your [firebase.json](/firebase.json) contains hosting configuration:
```json
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build/web",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
```

#### Deploying
```zsh
firebase deploy --only hosting

=== Deploying to 'fir-messaging-8b691'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: beginning deploy...
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: found 32 files in build/web
✔  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: file upload complete

✔  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: version finalized
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: releasing new version...
✔  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: release complete

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/csen268-s25-g0/overview
Hosting URL: https://csen268-s25-g0.web.app
```

### Accessing the Web App
The web app will be located at [https://csen268-s25-g0.web.app](https://csen268-s25-g0.web.app/)

### Git ignore  
Add `.firebase/` to your `.gitignore`

### Setting up your environment before the lecture

Each lecture is stored under a separate tag. On your computer do the following

    git clone <Repository Name>
    git pull
    git tag -l

This will list all the tags in the repository such as

    Lecture4
    Lecture5
    Lecture6
    ...

In order to pull a particular tag to your computer

    git checkout tags/Lecture5_start -b Lecture5_study
