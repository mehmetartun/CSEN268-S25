## Lecture 18 - Flutter Web, WebView and Ads
In this lecture we will explore Flutter Web, WebView and Ads

### Step 01 - Adding another Web App
As the owner of an App you would want to have an **admin** console where you can manage certain features of your app. You could build this functionality *inside* your client facing App accessible only to certain types of users, or you could build a separate app altogether **in the same codebase**.

#### Setting up an admin App in the same codebase
Create another `main.dart` file for the **admin App** called [main_admin.dart](/main_admin.dart).
```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  // FirebaseFunctions.instance.useFunctionsEmulator("localhost", 5001);
  runApp(MyAdminApp());
}

class MyAdminApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyAdminApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo Admin',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: GenericPage(title: "Welcome to Web - Admin App"),
    );
  }
}
```

#### Setting up launch.json to run the apps.
The default entry point to the app is [main.dart](/lib/main.dart) which doesn't need to be specified. Therefore, in the [launch.json](/.vscode/launch.json) file:
```json
        {
            "name": "CSEN268-S25",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "flutterMode": "debug"
        },
```
is the same as:
```json
        {
            "name": "CSEN268-S25",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "flutterMode": "debug",
            "program": "lib/main.dart"
        },
```

If we want to point to our admin app we need another entry in this file as:
```json
        {
            "name": "Admin CSEN268-S25",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "dart",
            "flutterMode": "debug",
            "program": "lib/main_admin.dart"
        },
```
Where we changed the **name** and the **program** for the **debug** mode. Similar addition need to be done for **profile** and **release** modes.

#### New Hosting Site
Our default hosting site was `https://csen268-s25-g0.web.app/`. We additionally created a new hosting site called: `https://csen268-s25-g0.web.app-admin.web.app/`. When we call `firebase deploy --only hosting` it's ambiguous as to where the deployment will be done. Therefore we define `target`s by adding the following to our [.firebaserc](/.firebaserc):
```json
  "targets": {
    "csen268-s25-g0": {
      "hosting": {
        "clientApp": [
          "csen268-s25-g0"
        ],
        "adminApp": [
          "csen268-s25-g0-admin"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```
and in the [firebase.json](/firebase.json) file:
```json
 "hosting": [
    {
      "target": "clientApp",
      "public": "build/web",
      "appAssociation": "AUTO",
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|eot|otf|ttf|ttc|woff|font.css)",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
              "value": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "target": "adminApp",
      "public": "build/web_admin",
      "appAssociation": "AUTO",
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|eot|otf|ttf|ttc|woff|font.css)",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
              "value": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
 ]
```
The last thing we need to do is when compiling the **admin App** we need to specify the output to `build/web_admin` and to specify the input as `lib/main_admin.dart`. Therefore the `build` command for the admin app is:
```zsh
flutter build web --release --output "build/web_admin"  --target "lib/main_admin.dart"
```

#### Deploying the Admin App
Now to deploy the **admin App** you would need to use the target in the following manner:
```zsh
firebase deploy --only hosting:adminApp
```
as `adminApp` is defined as the target. The resulting output will be:
```zsh
=== Deploying to 'csen268-s25-g0'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691-admin]: beginning deploy...
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691-admin]: found 33 files in build/web_admin
✔  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691-admin]: file upload complete

✔  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691-admin]: version finalized

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/csen268-s25-g0/overview
Hosting URL: https://csen268-s25-g0-admin.web.app
```
where on the top it's referring to the **project name** `csen268-s25-g0` but in subsequent lines it's referring to the hosting site `csen268-s25-g0-admin.web.app` or `csen268-s25-g0-admin.firebaseapp.com`.

To deploy the **client App** you would use:
```zsh
firebase deploy --only hosting:clientApp
```
and you would get:
```zsh
=== Deploying to 'fir-messaging-8b691'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: beginning deploy...
i  hosting[fir-messaging-8b691]: found 33 files in build/web
